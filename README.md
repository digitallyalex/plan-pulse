## Description
A daily planner for employees with a busy schedule, to help them input their daily tasks by the hour and keep track of time.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage 
![Plan Pulse Application Screenshot](./assets/images/plan_pulse_screenshot.png)
Users can input their plans into the text areas relevant to each time of the working day. Then, they can click the save button so they make sure to not lose the input if they close the page and open it again, or if they refresh it.
The dates and times are automatically updated, with colour-coding to signal the time that has passed, the current hour, and the remaining working time.
